# Employee_churn_prediction
Predicting employee churn using an interactive Decision tree and Random Forest classifier. 

As part of a guided project in coursera, we used a Decision tree and a Random Forest model to predict employee churn. We also made the corresponding models interactive to visualize different Decsion tree/random forest models in one go. We also evaluated our model using the ROCAUC curves and obtained over 90% AUC's for both the models.
